    <h2>The Entrances</h2>
    <div class="indent">
        <p>There are three main entrances student enter through to get into the school but students aren't allowed to just enter any random door they see.</p>
        <h3>The Center West Entrance</h3>
        <p>The Center West Entrance is where students with last names beginning with <b>A - L</b> enter. The Center West Entrance is typically closer to most of the train stations such as:<br>
            <ul>
                <li>Dekalb Avenue (B, Q, R)</li>
                <li>Nevins St (2, 3, 4, 5)</li>
                <li>Atlantic Av - Barclays Center (2, 3, 4, 5, B, D, N, Q, R)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>The Center East Entrance</h3>
        <p>The Center East Entrance is where students with last names beginning with <b>M - Z</b> enter. The Center East Entrance is typcally closer to the train station: <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Fulton St (G)</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <h3>The North East Entrance</h3>
        <p>Lastly, the North East Entrance are for students who come to school after second period, whether you start class third period or later, or just being late to class.</p>

    <h2>Getting Around The School</h2>
    <div class="indent">
        <h3>Classrooms</h3>
        <p>Although it may seem daunting at first, the general navigation of Brooklyn Tech's classsrooms is quite simple. The first digit is the floor number, the following letter is the cardinal direction the rooms' in(North, East, South, West, and Center), and the last one or two digits is the room number So a classroom such as <b>5E22</b> would be located on the 5th Floor, East side. In the image above, you can also see that room numbers increase counter-clockwise. </p>
        <h3>Stairs</h3>
        <div class="stairs">
            <img class="simg" src="Images/up-down-stairs.png" alt="Image of the Up and Down Stairs">
            <p class="stext">An important thing about the staircases in Brooklyn Tech are the "Up" and "Down" staircases. With so many students constantly travelling between rooms, the coordination on the stairs is very important. When you go up the stairs, make sure to go up the staircase you immediately see when you enter, and when you go down, go behind the up staircase to the down staircase. </p>
        </div>
        <h3>Elevators</h3>
        <p>Although students are allowed to use the elevators, there are restrictions. Normal students are only allowed on the AB and DE Elevators and those elevators only go from the first floor to the seventh. If you wanna go to one of the floors inbetween, you'll have to get lucky with a teacher willing to help select your floor or you can just take the stairs down. Of the other elevators, some are staff only, some are for student with medical passes, and some are for the students in Orchestra who have their classes on the 9th floor, on the roof. </p>
    </div>

    <h2>The Other Rooms</h2>
    <div class="indent">
        <p>The most annoying part about navigating Brooklyn Tech are the other rooms. There are quite a lot of gym rooms, some of which require specific staircases, our lunchroom is on the 7th floor, and the "center" areas are occupied by other rooms.</p>
        <h3>The Gymnasiums</h3>
        <p>Again, we have quite a few Gymnasiums. For starters, our <b>Swim Gym</b> is in the Basement. We also have two <b>Weight Rooms</b>, one larger than the other. The smaller one is also in the basement, and our larger weight room is on the 3rd floor South side. <br> <br>
        Of the "normal" gyms, you can be assigned in one of 3 locations. The <b>8th Floor Gymnasium</b> is on the 8th floor, and can only be accessed through the center staircases because the other staircases lead to the 8th floor classrooms. Either staircase West or East work but since the locker rooms are on the East side, I'd reccommend going on the East side. The <b>Roof Gym</b>, blatantly said, is a sad excuse of a gym. Since there are so many students and not enough gym rooms for said students, we have to move students to the roof. Similar to the 8th floor gym, it can only be accessed through the center staircases. Lastly, the <b>First Floor Gymnasium</b> is on the first floor, the entrance of which is through a small door on the South West side. This gym would be the easiest to navigate if its locker rooms weren't on the Third Floor South Side. Luckily there's another staircase in the back of those locker rooms that lead straight to the gym. While going down those stairs, when you decend to the second floor, that's where the entrance to our <b>Indoor Track</b> is located. The Indoor track is visible from inside the actual gym as it's suspended above the gym. Many students hate it because of how unstable it feels up there. </p>
        <h3>The Cafeteria</h3>
        <p>Opposite from the Gymnasiums, the Cafeteria, located on the 7th floor, can only be accessed from the corner staircases. If you go up the Center staircases, while you'll be able to see inside the lunchroom, you won't be allowed in. The typical AB DE Elevators do bring you up the cafeteria so that's a perk.</p>
        <h3>The Auditorium</h3>
        <p>Brooklyn Tech has quite a large auditorium spanning 4 floors total, occupying the center section of floors 1-4. Students typically aren't allowed to enter the auditorium unless its a assembly or a club meeting. The main entrance is on the first floor but you can enter the auditorium through any floor, and get to a higher floor or the mezzanine both from inside and outside the auditorium since there's also a staircase inside the auditorium. It's a shame it has absolutely no service and absolutely no ventilation. If you're in the mezzanine while its summer you'll feel like you're being cooked alive.</p>
        <h3>The Library</h3>
        <p>Where the Auditorium occupies the center sections of floors 1-4, the Library takes up the center section of the 5th floor. The library is a popular spot to loiter during free periods, but since it's only so big, there are limited seats. The entrance of the Library is on the West side and you'd exit through the East side. Students line up along the wall on the West side as a librarian or a library monitor slowly counts everyone in.</p>
        <h3>The Bathrooms</h3>
        <p>There are bathrooms on each floor except the 8th, but it'll still feel like it's not enough. The women's restrooms are located on the South West side on floors 2-7, and the men's restrooms are located on the North East side on floors 2-7. The locations are swapped on the first floor, where the women's restroom is on the North East and the men's are on the South West.
