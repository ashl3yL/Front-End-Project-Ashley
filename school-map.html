    <h3>The Entrances</h3>
    <p> There are typically 3 entrances you can enter through. Center West is for the students whose last names begin with A-L, and is closer to the Dekalb Av subway station. Center East is for the students whose last names begin with M-Z, and is closer to the Atalantic Avenue Barclays Center subway station. Finally, the North West entrance is for the students come to school after second period, either due to being late, or starting later in their schedules.</p>
    <h3>How to Get Around, Stairs, and Elevators</h3>
    <p>Though it may seem daunting at first, the general navigation of Brooklyn Tech is quite simple. The first digit is the floor number, the letter is the cardinal direction, and the last one or two digits are the room number so a classroom such as 5E22 would be located on the 5th floor East and a room number of 6C2 would be located on the 6th floor Center. If you ever get lost, just pull out a compass. Everyone does it sometimes. Another important thing about Brooklyn Tech are the staircases and elevators. When you first enter a stairwell, the staircase you see is the "up" staircase, if you want to go down, you head behind the staircase and go down that way. For the elevators, Students typically only have access to one that only goes from the first floor to the 7th. The other three elevaors are for the staff, students with medical passes, and students going to the orchestra room on the 9th floor.</p>
    <h3>The Special Rooms</h3>
    <p>The annoying part about navigating Brooklyn Tech are the other rooms. Brooklyn Tech has quite a lot of Gym rooms. We have two main Gymnasiums, one on the first floor, and one on the 8th both of which have locker rooms. The first floor gym has its locker rooms on the 3rd floor which has a staircase that connects back to the first floor gym. The 8th floor gym can only be accessed through the Center staircases, but since the locker rooms are on the 8th floor East side, it's reccommended that you go up through the Center East staircase. We have a very large auditorium that takes up the "Center" sections of floors 1-4 thanks to the mezzanines. The 5th floor Center is occupied by our Library. It's a popular spot for students to loiter during their free period but it has limited spots so many students race their way there. To keep it as organized as possible, the library only allows entrance through the West side, and students exit through the East side. The Bathrooms for the genders are located at opposite corners, with the Women's restroom being located South West and Men's restroom being located North East.</p>

    <!--start with a map of Brooklyn Tech's first floor, list locations, audi, bathrooms, how rooms are labeled, library, gym staircase, lunchroom staircase, which exits are closer to which stations, entrances for last names
    then go onto its surroundings, places to eat, subway stations, ftgreene park yada yada-->
