            <h3>About Tech</h3>
            <p>Brooklyn Tech is located at 29 Fort Greene Place, Brooklyn, NY 11217. Established in 1922, Brooklyn Tech celebrates their 100 year anniversary this year. Brooklyn Tech is one of the 9 specialized high schools in NYC, and the biggest to boot having 5,943 students as of the 2022-2023 school year. The school building takes up an entire block, and has classes on all floors from the basement to the 8th floor. As a high school that strives to prepare the students for college in any way possible, students are allowed to pick from one of our 18 majors at the end of their Sophomore year to have their Junior and Senior year catered to their selected major, just like college!
